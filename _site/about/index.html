  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  <p>Swedish software engineer currently residing in Beijing.</p>

<p>Started programming graphics in C/C++ at age 12, and was practically raised by
the European cracking/demoscene, where I competed in numerous graphics
programming competitions (demo and 64k) around Europe throughout my teenage
years.</p>

<p>After university, I started my career in one of Scandinavias largest telecom
operators TDC, where I stayed prior leaving to China in 2007.
During my time in China I have co-founded and taken engineering leader roles in
several start-ups in the technology space, including gaming, social networking,
mobile applications, finance technology and big data.</p>

<p>With around 20 years of hands-on experience in writing software across various
technology sectors, I strongly believe in good foundations, simplicity and
automation of everything possible, without creating leaky abstractions.</p>

<p>Apart from my professional life, I was part of the Swedish National Wushu Team,
and competed in both European and World Wushu Championships, this eventually
brought me to China in 2007. During this time I have also been coaching 1000+
students over several years.</p>

<p>I am fluent in English, Swedish and Mandarin Chinese and comfortable working in
multinational and cross-regional environments</p>
